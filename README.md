## Hi, I'm Kena 👩‍💻
### 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Science and Pure and Applied Mathematics at Stevens Institute of Technology!

### 💰 In summer 2024, I'll be working as a Software Development Intern on the Distributed Systems Development team at Tradeweb

### 🗺️ My interests outside of CS include traveling, making coffee, crocheting, and more!
- So far, I've been to over 15 countries. Some of my favorites are Spain, Thailand, Turkey, and Costa Rica! I'd like to visit the Philippines and Egypt next.
- I work as a barista and love perfecting my craft, especially when I get to drink them haha.
- Crocheting and watching Netflix is my favorite leisure activity, and I especially like making custom gifts for my friends.
