### Hi, I'm Kena
* 💸 I am a backend software developer at Tradeweb working on our algorithmic matching engine.
* 📚 I previously studied Computer Science at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, NJ.
  * 👩‍🏫 There, I assisted Professors Philippe Meunier (Algorithms), [Eduardo Bonelli](https://ebonelli.github.io/) (Concurrent Programming), Zumrut Akcam-Kibis (Data Structures), and Rocco Polimeni (Intro to CS).
  * 🏅 I took an interest in theoretical computer science and won the Stephen L Blooming Award departmental award upon my graduation.
* 🏙️ In terms of tech I'm currently interested in making a portfolio site (finally), getting more into networking, and going to more tech meetups in the city.
* 🐈 Outside of tech I'm interested in sustainable fashion, playing with my cat, and recently have gotting into Board Game Arena.
